# Error Message
Error occurred while implementing multiple RAG techniques

## Root Cause of the Error
There are several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques available, but there was no clear decision logic on which technique to use. This led to confusion and errors when trying to combine them in a single implementation.

## Different Approaches Tried Out
**First Approach**:
- Created an if-else ladder to manually switch between RAG techniques based on certain conditions.
- While functional, it quickly became messy and hard to maintain as more techniques were added.

**Second Approach**:
- Refactored the program into a modular structure where each RAG technique is encapsulated in its own module or function.
- This made the codebase more manageable and easier to extend.

## Selected Approach and Why?
Implemented a modular structure where each RAG technique is defined separately and called dynamically based on the input or configuration.

**Reason for Selection**:
- Improves readability and maintainability of the code.
- Simplifies debugging and testing by isolating each RAG method.
- Makes it easier to scale or replace individual techniques without affecting the whole system.

## Result
The final program works as intended. It is modular, readable, and effectively supports the use of multiple RAG techniques without conflict or confusion.
