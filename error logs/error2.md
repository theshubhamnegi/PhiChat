# Error Message
Model incompatible Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-q4.gguf

## Root Cause of the Error
The model format was not supported by the installed version of llama_cpp.

## Different Approaches Tried Out
**First Approach**:
- Verified the model path and file name in the code to ensure it pointed to the correct gguf model.

**Second Approach**:
- Re-downloaded the model from the official source to avoid corruption and ensured compatibility with the installed version of llama_cpp.

## Selected Approach and Why?
Re-downloading the model file in the correct gguf format and ensuring it's placed in the expected directory.

**Reason for Selection**:
- The downloaded model file was incompatible due to version mismatch. Re-downloading ensures both file integrity and compatibility.

- This approach resolves both path and corruption issues in one step.

## Result
After placing the correct model file, the model loaded successfully with llama_cpp and the server began processing inputs without errors.
